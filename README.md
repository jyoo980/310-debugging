## Requirements

You should have everything set up for this if you've followed the C0 instructions. I'll be using IntelliJ to show some debugging strategies. Note that IntelliJ and Webstorm share the same interface for debugging so you should be fine if you follow along with either one. As a UBC student, you also have free access to the
entire suite of JetBrains products.
